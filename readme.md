Hi There, this is Mahesh and in this repository I have uploaded various scripts for compression of videos, merging two videos horizontally and verttically.

## Libraries Use :
The libraries used are OpenCV and Numpy.

## Operations performed:
With these scripts you can change the aspect ratio of videos of differnt resolutions. Further you can merge two videos horizontally or vertically.

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.6+
2. numpy==2.2.2
3. opencv-python==4.11.0.86

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the required libraries from requirements.txt
4. Pick any operation of your choice.
5. Make sure to give the correct path of the video.
6. Some scripts like merging two videos horizontally and vertically requires two videos of either same width or height so make sure to use correct videos.
7. Enjoy.

I also left some files in the repository which I used for testing. I hope it would save your lots of time and wold also be beneficial to you.

## Thanks.
